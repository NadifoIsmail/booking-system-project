#  Hotel Booking System
#### Hotel Booking System is a command-line interface (CLI) application designed to simplify the process of managing hotel room bookings. Users can book rooms, view their bookings, and manage them, while administrators can handle room details and oversee bookings efficiently. The project uses Python and SQLAlchemy for robust database management and CRUD operations.
